## _Description_:

An ORM (object relational mapping) that provides a **client** that is used to allow the application to work with a database. When installed, it generates a prisma.schema file that uses its own syntax to define the schema of database tables.

On **migration**, prisma will generate the changes made in the schema in the database provider's syntax.

## Core Concepts:

### Important CLI commands:

- prisma format -> makes the prisma schemas "pretty"
- prisma migrate dev -> do after making changes to the schema file

### Projects Used:
