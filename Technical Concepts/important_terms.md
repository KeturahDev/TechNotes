## Important Terms:

- Concurrency: the ability of a system to perform multiple tasks at the same time or in overlapping time frames. It's a common feature in modern programming.

- ORM: Object-relational mapping. ActiveRecord from Ruby on Rails does this, so does prisma. It allows modals to coordinate the logic of shaping database tables, one model equating to a table.

- RESTful API: "REpresentational State Transfer". An archetectural style that uses a stateless client-server communication model to handle resources (data, functions) via HTTP methods (GET POST PUT DELETE)
