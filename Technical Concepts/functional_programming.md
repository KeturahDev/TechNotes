## _Description_:

Functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are built by composing functions, treating them as first-class citizens, meaning they can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned as values, and used like any other data type. This allows for a declarative style of coding with a focus on immutability and pure functions to achieve a predictable and modular approach to problem solving.

Essentially, it's about breaking down a problem into smaller, reusable functions that only take inputs and produce outputs without modifying any external state.

Composition: Combining smaller functions to create more complex functionality.

## Core Concepts:

Immutability:

- Functional programming emphasizes _creating new data structures instead of modifying existing ones_, leading to more predictable state management.

Declarative style:

- Functional code focuses on _describing what you want to achieve rather than how to achieve_ it step-by-step (which is more procedural).

Pure Functions:

- Functional programming encourages writing functions that _always return the same output for the same input_, making code easier to test and reason about.

First-class Functions:

- Functions can be treated like any other data type, allowing them to be passed around and manipulated

### Pros:

- Readability and maintainability: Functional programming produces code that is easier to understand and maintain.
- Modularity: Functional programming can create shorter, more modular code.
- Debugging: Functional programming makes debugging easier by breaking down complex logic into reusable functions.
- Concurrency: Functional programming makes it easier to keep concurrency safe.
- Scalability: Functional programming promotes modularity and code composition, which makes it easier to develop scalable applications.
- Reliability: Functional programming reduces common programming errors, making it a good choice for industries where software reliability is important

### Relevence:

- React use to use class components (Which were OOP- Each instance of a class component was an object with its own state and methods.) but now utilizes functional components and hooks.

### Projects Used:

- []()
