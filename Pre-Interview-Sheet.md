# Before your interview

### During the interview:

- Typos and stuttering isn't a big deal, dont appologize for it! Everyone understands interview nerves
- They are wondering what it would be like to work with you. So be good company! Be warm and happy. Express positivity towards the presented questions and activity.
- Be honest with what you don't know, and ask for input when you could use it. The point is to show how you think, and code. Not how you know everything.

### Do this before:

- Big Breathes!
- Dance, wiggle your arms!
- Stand tall! Reach down, up, breathe again!

### Keep this in mind:

- You are excited to be here!
- The adrenalin is your body preparing to do something awesome!
- My bubbly personality is likable and energizing, let the smiles out!
- You got this!!!
