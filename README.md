## Purpose of these files

These files are storage for concept notes of the languages I come accross on my developer journey. Whether I'm taking away concept keys from docs, going step by step outloud through tutorials, these notes are meant to be a paper trail to mark what I've learned, and provide brief/effective brush up information.
