## _Description_

This is just a personal log of the various services I dont want to forget about:

## Services

**Amplify**: hosting

**DynamoDB**: NoSQL database

**RedShift**: relational db

- no primary keys
- very big cloud data warehouse
- not optimal for fetching, good for archiving

**Aurora**: MySQL database
