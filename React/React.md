- Hooks (useState, useEffect, costom hooks)
- State Management (Context API vs Zustand vs Redux)

- Patterns & Best Practices

## Hooks:

### useState:

used for storing local state

### useEffect:

This hook is required for managing code dependent on the component **_life cycle_**, such as on mount, on updateand on dismount.

used for running code based on the dependency array (second arg). If empty, on runs on mount.

- component did mount: empty dependency array.
- component rerendered: no dependency array.
- component unmount: return statement in the first arg's function.
